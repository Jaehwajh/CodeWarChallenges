// current age of his son (years)

/*
Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
The correct answer would be 17.

Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

1.08 --> 30
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
