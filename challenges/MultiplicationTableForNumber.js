/*
Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:

1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
P. S. You can use \n in string to jump to the next line.

Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.
