## CodeWarChallenges
Welcome to my daily Codewar challenge Repository

I try to do at least one to five codewar problems per day or more if I'm up for it. I mainly solve Javascript problems.

## Optimizations

I often try to resolve and optimize my code, mainly for redundancy, and sometimes for efficiency.
